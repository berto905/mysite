  <h1> Assignment for Week 3</h1>
  <div>
    <p>
      This is the first webpage I created as part of an assignment for Django
      for Everybody Specialization in Coursera. It has some tags requirement.
      This paragraph is part of <strong>p</strong> tag requirement. </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Now this sentence is for <strong>ul</strong> tag requirement.</li>
      <li> Life is so <span style="color:red">colorful</span>. Hey, that is
      <strong>span</strong> tag! </li>
      <li>It is also <em>emphasized</em> that this page has 3
      <strong>a</strong> tags requirement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So, aside from this webpage, there are two files I make in this
      assignment: one <a href="hello.txt">text</a> file, one<a
      href="http://liberto.pythonanywhere.com/site/subfolder/hello.html">
      webpage</a> file. Everytime I am confused, I just <a href="https://www.google.com/">
      google</a> it!
